object* parse(char* path) - will build an object from an OBJ file and its associated MTL file, both must be in the working directory, the faces array is an interleved array of floats containing all the data, this can be used in something like an OpenGL VBO, Vulkan VkBuffer, Metal MTLBuffer or whatever directx calls it's equivalent. MTL file (not to be confused with metal) is optional, the different materials will be in an array of structs that contains a pointer that points to where the material starts in the face buffer as well as its length and all the relevant material information, texture file names can be extracted and the appropriate path can be created with them.

void delete(object* obj) - cleanup function, frees all created memory from an object.
